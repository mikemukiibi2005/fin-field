# Finite Fields

Finite fields are at the core of public key cryptography, which has found widespread use in modern digital communication protocols such as `HTTP` and the Signal end to end encryption protocol, implemented in popular instant messaging applications, Whatsapp and Signal.

The security of the Web 3.0 ecosystem lend itself to the assumptions made in the [Discrete Log Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm).

The `cargo` crate is a naive implementation of the fundamental operations used in generating key pairs.


The project demonstrates many of the fundamental aspects of the `rust` programming language.
